query_shoe = '''Tying your shoes is a basic skill that every child learns and every adult should know. Here's a simple guide to help you learn how to tie your shoes:

Begin by holding the laces in each hand, with your fingers spread near the toes ends.
Cross the longer lace over the shorter lace, and place it on top of the shorter lace.
Take the longer lace (on the right) and pass it under the shorter lace, and bring it back up on the other side of the shorter lace.
Pull the longer lace (on the right) through the loop that just appeared briefly, and pull it snug.
Repeat steps 3 and 4 for the other lace.
Cross the longer lace (on the left) over the shorter lace, and place it on top of the shorter lace.
Take the longer lace (on the left and pass it under the shorter lace,) and bring it back up on the other side of the shorter lace.
Pull the longer lace (on the left) through the loop that just appeared briefly, and pull it snug.
At this point, you have crossed the longest laces twice and passed them under the shortest laces twice, so the laces are now tied into a double knot at the top.
Follow these steps again for the other lace or repeat the entire process until you become confident with the tying.
Keep practicing until the laces are easily tied every time. Don't get discouraged if you're having difficulty at first; it takes time and patience to perfect this skill.'''
